### Create new release/tag:

Tags are used to mark specific points in a repository's history. They're often used to release new versions of software, but they can also be used to mark other important events, such as milestones or bug fixes.

Here are the steps on how to add a tag to a GitHub repository:
1. Navigate to the main page of the repo.
2. Click on the "Releases" tab.
3. Click on the "Draft a new release" button.
4. Enter a title and description for the release.
5. Enter the tag name in the "Choose tag" dropdown field input.
6. Click "Create a new tag" with the tag name you entered.
7. Click on the "Publish release" button.

Once you've published the release, the tag will be visible in the "Tags" tab of the repository.
